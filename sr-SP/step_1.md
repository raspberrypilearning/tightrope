## Introduction:

In this project you will create a game in which you have to tilt your Sense HAT to guide a character along a path. If you fall off the path, you have to start again from the beginning!

## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn about the Sense HAT orientation sensor by creating a line-follownig game. The player tilts the Sense HAT to move the character along a path. Deviating from the path sends the player back to the start!

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Tightrope' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/tightrope-go](http://jumpto.cc/tightrope-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

* [‘Tightrope’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/790adaa749](https://trinket.io/python/790adaa749)

## Offline Resources

This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* tightrope/main.py
* tightrope/snippets.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* tightrope-finished/main.py
* tightrope-finished/snippets.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* Sense HAT orientation (roll, pitch and yaw);
* Sense HAT display;
* RGB colours;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* "Create your own path" - creating a image using a list of pixels;
* "Moving up!" - moving the character up in response to changing `roll` values.
* "Changing the difficulty" - testing the finished game and making changes based on player feedback.
