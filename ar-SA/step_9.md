## Challenge: Changing the difficulty

Ask some friends to test your game. Did they find it too easy or too hard? If so, you could make some changes:

+ Change the path the character has to follow;
+ Change the `pitch` and `roll` values that move your character;
+ Add a short or longer `sleep` at the end of your loop.
